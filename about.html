                            <p>I am currently living in Helsingborg, Sweden, studying Grundläggande Programmering. Prior
                                to that I spent a couple of seasons working abroad for the travel company TUI UK, before
                                which I studied History at the University of
                                Reading. I grew up using computers on a daily basis and I'm now hoping to be able to
                                develop my skills and begin a career in computer programming. In order to achieve that
                                goal, I have enrolled on a course for Grundläggande
                                Programmering at Komvux Helsingborg and in C# at Malmo University in Autumn 2020. I also
                                studied a Web Development Course on Pluralsight whilst simultaneously using Mimo in
                                order to ensure I had a full understanding of
                                the basics of HTML and CSS. Having completed those courses, I have begun studying
                                Harvard University's CS50x course, where I have developed my understanding of computer
                                science, and have learnt how to write programs in
                                C, ranging from a simple text encryption program to a program which applies filters to
                                images, and even programs to determine the outcome of elections.</p>
                            <p>Outside of my work and studies, I have a passion for squash, snowboarding and all things
                                travel. I've been lucky enough to spend two seasons abroad working for TUI - one season
                                in the French Alps and one in Crete. I've also
                                spent two months backpacking around South America in 2015 and a month interrailing
                                around Europe in 2016.</p>
